This topic gives a high-level conceptual overview and introduction to <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>). It is designed to:

* Introduce the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> runtime to people who are unfamiliar with it.

* Provide context and explanations that support the how-to information in the Tanzu Application Service documentation.

* Explain that you can get started running apps without installing Ops Manager
  and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> by using Pivotal Web Services or PCF Dev.

If you want to learn about how <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> works or test it out yourself, this guide is for you.
